\chapter{Background}
Magnetic resonance imaging is, as the name suggests, enabled by the phenomenon of magnetic resonance. Atoms with an odd
number of protons or neutrons possess net nuclear spin, and therefore effectively have small magnetic moments which can
be made to resonate at a precisely defined frequency in the presence of a static magnetic field. Hydrogen
(\ce{^{1}_{1}H}) is such an atom, and is the main candidate for clinical imaging because of the abundance of \ce{H2O} in
living things \cite{nishimura}.
