\chapter{Discussion}
The modest SNR improvement seen in unaccelerated imaging is likely attributed to the deep (nearly central) location of
the fetal head where coil arrays with more than 16 elements already approach the ultimate SNR available
\cite{Wiesinger2004}.  Nonetheless, because the SNR is achieved with array elements with higher spatial frequency
sensitivity profiles, there is an improvement in acceleration capability.
