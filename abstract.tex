MRI is an attractive tool for fetal imaging due to its unique ability to provide detailed anatomical and physiological
data in an inherently safe manner. In practice, fetal MRI is limited by fetal motion, inherently poor SNR in the
maternal abdomen, and widely varying body shapes. A 64 channel receive array designed to conform to a range of body
shapes at 22 weeks of pregnancy was built and tested. Compared to standard product arrays, the coil provides 5% better
SNR in the fetal brain region of an anthropomorphic phantom and allows increasing SENSE acceleration factor from R=4 to
R=5.
