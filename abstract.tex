MRI is an attractive tool for fetal imaging due to its unique ability to provide detailed anatomical and physiological
data in an inherently safe manner. In practice, the problem of unpredictable and nonrigid fetal motion limits fetal MRI
to fast single shot T2 weighted sequences such as HASTE, which have poor tissue contrast, low SNR, and cannot provide
detailed physiological information. Compared to standard product arrays, the coil provides roughly $5\%$ better SNR in
the fetal brain region of an anthropomorphic phantom and allows increasing SENSE acceleration factor from $R=4$ to $R=5$
in the right-left direction and $R=3$ to $R=4$ in the head-foot direction.
